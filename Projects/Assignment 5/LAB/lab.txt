Lab Notebook
To start with this lab, I started by making myself a big file using the
command: dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile.txt bs=1M count=5

Moving on, I looked at the lab spec and tested to better understand what
the spec was asking me to do. By running 
'printf 123456789 | tr 13579 abcde'
This returned: a2b4c6d8e
From this note, I knew to develop some type of script that took arguments
and then implemented the tr command. Additionally, I could ignore overall
options.

Proceeding on, I started my first program: emacs tr2b.c and tr2u.c

In this, I ran into a few issues with  forgetting the library in tr2u.c
However, the structure of my  code was as follows:

Check number of arguments is three
Assign pointers to argument parameters
Check pointers have same length
Check for no repetition
Get first character of the input
Repeatedly
     Check if that character matches any from
	If so, write in from and continue
     If no character written yet
	Write character given
     Get new character

For the strace result, I ran the following:
strace -o straceRes_tr2b.txt ./tr2b 12345 abcde < bigfile.txt
and
strace -o straceRes_tr2u.txt ./tr2u 12345 abcde < bigfile.txt

The difference above was that the one invoking system calls started printing
the entire document, whereas the first one printed only the first line of the
document.

Running the time command on the bigfile.txt, I get
time ./tr2b 12345 abcde < bigfile.txt
Outputs:
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s

time tr2u 12345 abcde < bigfile.txt
Outputs:
real	0m0.001s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s
