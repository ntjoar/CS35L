To make a checkout on a new branch quote, I ran
'git checkout v3.0 -b quote'

Running the patch file, I used 
'patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt'.
Output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

Making the changelog,
'emacs'
'C-x 4 a'
'C-x C-s'
'C-x C-c'

Running the git functions, I ran 
'git add .'
'git commit -F ChangeLog'
Output:

Finally, I formatted using
'git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt'

For the lab testing, I worked with Harry Ramli (505148131).
Running his patch with 'git am', I got it to be functional and it seemed to 
work regardless.

In running gitk, a popup of XQuartz came up with this.
The XQuartz file earliest merge came at 1-24-2015.
