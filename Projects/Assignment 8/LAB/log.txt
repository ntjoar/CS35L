Lab Notebook

For this lab, I worked with Jersey Deng.

First step preliminary to the lab, I set up the Beaglebone
following these instructions:
Connect your BeagleBone to your computer using the USB cable.
Find BEAGLEBONE as an external storage device and open it.
Run START.htm and download the drivers

Due to difficulty of green lighting the second step, I ran:
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/HoRNDIS.kext
Restart Computer
sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

Setting up wifi was done by
sudo connmanctl
enable wifi
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
3760ClassNet
quit

I ran this to get my IP:
ifconfig

I ran this to get appropriate files:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb

I ran these to get my apps for the lab:
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
sudo apt-get install xterm
sudo apt-get install gedit

My IP: 10.97.85.144
Partner IP is: 10.97.85.142

ssh-keygen to generate ssh key.
Passhrase: Password

Create user and password
sudo useradd -d /home/jdeng -m jdeng
     By default, I used default library to do this part.
sudo passwd jdeng
Password: TmpPass

Setup ssh directory using:
cd /home/jdeng
sudo mkdir .ssh

Setup permission using:
sudo chown –R jdeng .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Similarly, I followed my partner's steps for being the client:
User: ntjoar
Password: ucla
Generating the public/private key
ssh-keygen

Copying the key to the host
ssh-copy-id –i ntjoar@10.97.85.142

Add private key to authentication host
ssh-add

SSH Connection
ssh ntjoar@10.97.85.142
Trying to run on this command gave me display errors

ssh -X ntjoar@10.97.85.142
Trying to run on this opened up applications successfully

ssh -Y ntjoar@10.97.85.142
Trying to run on this gave me the same results as if I ran on 
-X

To load	a terminal on my partner's server:
xterm

To load a untitled text document, I ran:
gedit

To load a firefox browser on my partner's server:
firefox
