Homework answers
1. Due to asymmetric key encryption, regardless of whether or not the other 
   teams had been watching the  data, it would have been secure enough to 
   get by undetected with regards to contents in the file. With this, the 
   other teams would only  be able to look at the file encrypted, without
   any way of opening it without the key. However, this could change if the
   other team had our keystrokes, as we set password, user ID and other
   things using it. As a result, we would be rendered helpless. Even worse,
   if we booted off of a USB, the network would be at its most unsecure if
   the other team had control over it at any time. This would give them 
   access to all the keys and give them dominion to install any spyware 
   if they so wished.

2. gpg --verify is unable to verify the ownership of data because it only 
   compares digital signature to encrypted data. Data signatures can still
   be changed regardless with a man in the middle attack,  thus changing
   ownership of the data.
   The only way for us to keep track of the owner/author of a given document
   is to trust in a third party application that could access the file and
   who it was created by/what certificate they have on the file. The certificate
   could essentially be an open possibility to a method of keeping track of 
   multiple file authors.
