Winter 2019 CS 32
Programming Assignment 1
Club Zombie
Time due: 11:00 PM Tuesday, January 15

The appendix to this document is the specification of the last CS 31 project from a previous quarter. We will provide you with a correct1 solution to that project. Your assignment is to (1) organize the code for the solution in appropriate header and implementation files, and (2) implement a new feature.

You should read the appendix now. It describes a game in which a player has to survive in an arena full of zombies. You will be working with this code that implements the game. Notice that it is a single file. (Just so you know, the way we tested its correctness is similar to how we'll test the correctness of the programs you write in CS 32.)

Organize the code
Take the single source file, and divide it into appropriate header files and implementation files, one pair of files for each class. Place the main routine in its own file named main.cpp. Make sure each file #includes the headers it needs. Each header file must have include guards.

Now what about the global constants? Place them in their own header file named globals.h. And what about utility functions like randInt or clearScreen that are used by the implementations of more than one class? Place them in their own implementation file named utilities.cpp, and place their prototype declarations in globals.h. (Note that for utility functions like decodeDirection that are used by only one class implementation, it would be better to declare and implement them in that class's implementation file, not in globals.h.)

The Visual C++ 2017 and the Xcode writeups demonstrate how to create a multi-file project. From the collection of the eleven files produced as a result of this part of the project, make sure you can build an executable file that behaves exactly the same way as the original single-file program. Make sure you can also do this with g++ with Linux.

Add a feature
If you try running the updated programs (the Windows version, the Mac version, or the Linux version of the full game, and the Mac version or the Linux version of the smaller version of the game [sorry, no Windows version]), you'll see they have one new command you can type: h for history. This command shows you for each grid point, how many times during the course of the game the player has dealt a fatal blow to a zombie that was standing at that location: dot means 0, a letter character A through Y means 1 through 25 (A means 1, B means 2, etc.) and Z means 26 or more.

Your task is to implement this functionality. You will need to do the following:

Define a class named History with the following public interface:

       class History
       {
         public:
	     History(int nRows, int nCols);
	         bool record(int r, int c);
		     void display() const;
		     };
The constructor initializes a History object that corresponds to an Arena with nRows rows and nCols columns. You may assume (i.e., you do not have to check) that it will be called with a first argument that does not exceed MAXROWS and a second that does not exceed MAXCOLS, and that neither argument will be less than 1.
The record function is to be called to notify the History object that a zombie has died at the indicated location in the Arena that the History object corresponds to. The function returns false if row r, column c is not within bounds; otherwise, it returns true after recording what it needs to. This function expects its parameters to be expressed in the same coordinate system as the Arena (e.g., row 1, column 1 is the upper-left-most position).
The display function clears the screen and displays the history grid as the posted programs do. This function does clear the screen, display the history grid, and write an empty line after the history grid; it does not print the Press enter to continue. after the display. (Note to Xcode users: It is acceptable that clearScreen() just writes a newline instead of clearing the screen if you launch your program from within Xcode, since the Xcode output window doesn't have the capability of being cleared.)
The class declaration (with any private members you choose to add to support your implementation) must be in a file named History.h, and the implementation of the History class's member functions must be in History.cpp. If you wish, you may add a public destructor to the History class. You must not add any other public members to the class. (This implies, for example, that you must not add a public default constructor.) The only member function of the History class that may write to cout is History::display.

Add a data member of type History (not of type pointer-to-History) to the Arena class, and provide this public function to access it; notice that it returns a reference to a History object.

    class Arena
    {
      …
        History& history();
	  …
	  };
When a zombie dies, its arena's history object must be notified about the position where it died.

Have the Game recognize the new h command, tell its arena's history object to display the history grid, and then print the Press enter to continue. prompt and wait for the user to respond. (cin.ignore(10000,'\n'); does that nicely.) Typing the h command does not count as the player's turn.

Turn it in
By Monday, January 14, there will be a link on the class webpage that will enable you to turn in your source files. You do not have to turn in a report or other documentation for this project. What you will turn in for this project will be one zip file containing only the thirteen files you produced, no more and no less. The files must have these names exactly:

Zombie.h   Player.h    History.h  Arena.h   Game.h globals.h	  
Zombie.cpp Player.cpp  History.cpp	    Arena.cpp		  Game.cpp	utilities.cpp	main.cpp
The zip file itself may be named whatever you like.

If we take these thirteen source files, we must be able to successfully build an executable using g322 and one using either Visual C++ or clang++ — you must not introduce compilation or link errors.

If you do not follow the requirements in the above paragraphs, your score on this project will be zero. "Do you mean that if I do everything right except misspell a file name or include an extra file or leave off one semu are free to make changeArena.h should inlude "le with the following, the program must not build successfully; attempting to compile it should produce an error message like 'p' uses undefined class 'Player' or variable has incomplete type 'Player' or variable 'Player p' has initializer but incomplete type (and perhaps other error messages):

   #include "Zombie.h"
   #include "Arena.h"
   int main()
   {
       Arena a(10, 20);
           Player p(&a, 2, 3);
	       Zombie z(&a, 1, 1);
	       }
If we replace your main.cpp file with the following, the program must not build successfully; attempting to compile it should produce an error message like 'z' uses undefined class 'Zombie' or variable has incomplete type 'Zombie' or variable 'Zombie z' has initializer but incomplete type (and perhaps other error messages):

   #include "Player.h"
   #include "Arena.h"
   int main()
   {
       Arena a(10, 20);
           Player p(&a, 2, 3);
	       Zombie z(&a, 1, 1);
	       }
If we replace your main.cpp file with the following, the program must not build successfully; attempting to compile it should produce an error message like 'a' uses undefined class 'Arena' or variable has incomplete type 'Arena' or variable 'Arena a' has initializer but incomplete type (and perhaps other error messages):

   #include "globals.h"
   #include "Zombie.h"
   #include "Player.h"
   int main()
   {
       Arena a(10, 10);
       }
If we replace your main.cpp file with the following, the program must not build successfully; attempting to compile it should produce an error message like 'History' : no appropriate default constructor available or no matching constructor for initialization of 'History' or no matching function for call to 'History::History()' (and perhaps other error messages):

   #include "History.h"
   int main()
   {
       History h;
       }
If a .cpp file uses a class or function declared in a particular header file, then it should #include that header. The idea is that someone writing a .cpp file should not worry about which header files include other header files. For example, a .cpp file using an A object and a B object should include both A.h (where presumably the class A is declared) and B.h (where B is declared), without considering whether or not A.h includes B.h or vice versa.
To create a zip file on a SEASnet machine, you can select the thirteen files you want to turn in, right click, and select "Send To / Compressed (zipped) Folder". Under macOS, copy the files into a new folder, select the folder in Finder, and select File / Compress "folderName"; make sure you copied the files into the folder instead of creating aliases to the files.

Advice
Developing your solution incrementally will make your work easier. Start by making sure you can build and run the original program successfully with the one source file having the name main.cpp. Then, starting with Zombie, say, produce Zombie.h, removing the code declaring the Zombie class from main.cpp, but leaving in main.cpp the implementation of the Zombie member functions. Get that two-file solution to work. Also, make sure you meet those of the requirements above that involve only the Zombie.h header.

Next, split off Player.h, testing the now three-file solution and also making sure you meet those of the requirements above that involve only the Zombie.h and Player.h headers. Continue in this manner until you've produced all the required headers (except History.h, since you're not yet adding the history feature), the whole program still works, and you meet all the applicable requirements.

Now split off the member function implementations of, say, Zombie, putting them in Zombie.cpp. Test everything again. You see where this is going. The basic principle is to not try to produce all the files at once, because many misconceptions you have will affect many files. This will make it difficult to fix all those problems, since many of them will interfere with each other. By tackling one file at a time, and importantly, not proceeding to another until you've got everything so far working, you'll keep the job manageable, increasing the likelihood of completing the project successfully and, as a nice bonus, reducing the amount of time you spend on it.
