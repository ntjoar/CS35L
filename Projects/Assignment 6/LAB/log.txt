To start, I ran 'sort --version' in order to check the version of sort I had

To run the command with a shell script, so I scripted a little script in order
to evaluate the expression using the power value. This would then construct
the file using the od command. 
In essence, I used the following commands:
#!/bin/bash                                                                     

n=24
total=$((2**24*4))

od -An -t fF -N $total < /dev/urandom |
tr -s [:blank:] '\n' |
sed '/^$/d' > random.txt

$total was the value of 2^24 from the script

In order to check the time it took to sort, I ran
'time -p sort -g random.txt > /dev/null'
Output:
real 8.32
user 44.80
sys 0.20

To check the difference with parallel threads, I ran parallel with 1, 2, 4, 
and 8 threads to see time difference. The command and respective ouput is 
as recorded below.
time -p sort -g --parallel=1 random.txt > /dev/null
Output:
real 185.76
user 185.40
sys 0.32

time -p sort -g --parallel=2 random.txt > /dev/null
Output:
real 105.98
user 201.98
sys 0.52

time -p sort -g --parallel=4 random.txt > /dev/null
Output:
real 58.16
user 197.68
sys 0.58

time -p sort -g --parallel=8 random.txt > /dev/null
Output:
real 41.42
user 234.39
sys 0.77
